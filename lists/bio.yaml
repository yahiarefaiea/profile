  - Hey! I’m Yahia. A Syrian creative developer heavily influenced by experience design and storytelling.
  - As an experience designer, I enjoy diving headfirst into building experiences and understanding user behaviors and pain points to align with business needs and help growth.
  - As a creative developer, I aim to <strong>build engaging and eye-catching digital experiences</strong>; all backed up by a solid background in JavaScript, Node.js, CSS preprocessors, and templating engines. I also have a keen interest in <strong>CSS and animations</strong>.
  - Being in the field <strong>for 9 years</strong> -both as a designer and developer- helped me understand the full-cycle of creating products and opened the door for me to found a web design and development agency and lead people to build and deliver emotional and captivating experiences.
  - My work was nominated and honored on <strong>Codepen, CSS Design Awards, and UpLabs</strong>. And I found it fun and inspiring to become a developer advocate, where I share my work and knowledge with the open-source community and end up <strong>having ~100K views on my Codepen</strong>.
  - Currently, I breathe-talking about combining technology, creativity, and storytelling—to produce an interactive book that not just tells a story—but allows the reader to live it. The book is expected to be out in 2025.
  - When I’m not working on my book, you’ll find me holding a pencil as I brainstorm ideas for my next crazy side-project.
  - Fun fact, people think I’m obsessed with stickers, and I wouldn’t need a resume anymore—because they believe I got stickers for all the required skills for my dream job, and all that is left is to go outside and accidentally run into the recruiter—LOL! But I don’t think life works as they say. They don’t know what is in my dreams~ anyway.

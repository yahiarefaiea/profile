  title: Design lead
  employer: Nuotron
  description: When a founder starts small, wearing many hats is essential for the business to grow. I’ll brief what I love wearing the most—the designer and developer hats! My responsibility was to lead the team and help them -not just with the creative process- but with the full-cycle of creating products—from first call with client to analyze requirements and winning the deal—to researching, planning, ideation and prototyping—all the way to designing, developing, and delivering the final product.

  title: Independent creative developer
  description: I’m combining technology, creativity, and storytelling—to produce an interactive book that not just tells a story—but allows the reader to live it. Solving tests, taking up challenges, collecting memories, and taking someone else’s place allows the reader to feel, think, react, and become as involved in the story as the main character. Also, the personalized experience inside the book allows him to express himself and face those fears and bad memories that have been hunting him for years. And just by expressing himself, he becomes mentally better. Many people shared a breathtaking vision and collaborated shoulder to shoulder to deliver this piece of artwork. And one of my responsibilities was to lead a 25-30 people size team from researching, planning, designing, and developing experiences, illustrations, characters, calligraphies, and merch, all the way to content-writing, 3D modeling, videography, augmented reality, and music composing. The book is expected to be out in 2025.

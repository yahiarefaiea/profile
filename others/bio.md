Hey! I'm Yahia. ***A Syrian creative developer heavily influenced by experience design and storytelling.***

As an experience designer, I enjoy diving headfirst into building experiences and understanding user behaviors and pain points to align with business needs and help growth.

As a creative developer, I aim to build engaging and eye-catching digital experiences; all backed up by a solid background in JavaScript, Node.js, CSS preprocessors, and templating engines. I also have a keen interest in CSS and animations.

***Being in the field for 9 years*** -both as a designer and developer- helped me understand the full-cycle of creating products and ***opened the door for me to found a web design and development agency and lead people to build and deliver emotional and captivating experiences.***

***My work was nominated and honored on Codepen, CSS Design Awards, and UpLabs.*** And I found it fun and inspiring to become a developer advocate and share my work and knowledge with the open-source community ***and end up having ~100K of views on my Codepen.***

Currently, I breathe-talking about combining technology, creativity, and storytelling—to produce an interactive book that not just tells a story—but allows the reader to live it. The book is expected to be out in 2025.

When I'm not working on my book, you'll find me holding a pencil as I brainstorm ideas for my next crazy side-project.

***Fun fact,*** people think ***I'm obsessed with stickers***, and I wouldn't need a resume anymore—because they believe I got stickers for all the required skills for my dream job, and all that is left is to go outside and accidentally run into the recruiter—LOL! But I don't think life works as they say. They don't know what is in my dreams~ anyway.

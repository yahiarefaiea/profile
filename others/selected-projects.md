# Aqra Arabi
An e-learning and school management system targeting institutions in UAE, allowing their students to take curriculum classes and exams online. I was responsible for wireframing, designing, and developing responsive mobile-first interfaces, drawing storyboards and working with animations, and building a style guide and a custom HTML and CSS library from the ground up using Sass, Jade, jQuery, along with Grunt as a task-runner.

# Rapida
A set of Node.js starter-kits and helpers that helps our team at Nuotron speed development, increase quality, encourage consistency and avoid repeating work on how to handle minification, automation, transpiling, linting, bundling, cache busting, (and more..) every time we start a new project.

# Personal Website of 2018
As a freelancer, I found that investing in side-projects uplifts my skill set, boosts my career, and attracts better clients. So, as a result of my investment, my website was nominated for WOTD, received Special Kudos on CSSDA, and was listed as 21st place on Codepen Most Hearted Pens of 2018 with ~56K views.

# Nucubuc Survey
A survey I designed to reach to my old clients so I can draw their attention to some micro animations and visual interactions, collect their feedback, and at the same time, win them as clients again. I also uploaded the code as open-source on GitHub and Codepen and ended up having ~15K views.

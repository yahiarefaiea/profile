### Hey! I’m Yahia. A Syrian creative developer heavily influenced by experience design and storytelling.

As an experience designer, I enjoy diving headfirst into building experiences and understanding user behaviors and pain points to align with business needs and help growth.

As a creative developer, I aim to **build engaging and eye-catching digital experiences**; all backed up by a solid background in JavaScript, Node.js, CSS preprocessors, and templating engines. I also have a keen interest in **CSS and animations**.

Being in the field **for 9 years** -both as a designer and developer- helped me understand the full-cycle of creating products and opened the door for me to found a web design and development agency and lead people to build and deliver emotional and captivating experiences.

My work was nominated and honored on **Codepen, CSS Design Awards, and UpLabs**. And I found it fun and inspiring to become a developer advocate, where I share my work and knowledge with the open-source community and end up **having ~100K views on my Codepen**.

Currently, I breathe-talking about combining technology, creativity, and storytelling—to produce an interactive book that not just tells a story—but allows the reader to live it. The book is expected to be out in 2025.

When I’m not working on my book, you’ll find me holding a pencil as I brainstorm ideas for my next crazy side-project.

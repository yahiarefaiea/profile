  decision: Dropped out of
  subject: high school
  description: After having open-heart surgery and facing death at a young age, I understood what it means to wake up in the morning having the chance to live another 24 hours and how important it is to spend this time on something to help build my future. I don’t have a problem with academic education, except when it consumes both my time and energy for nothing worth in return. I remember myself in bed—passionately rescuing my future by reading hundreds of articles about web development. But for everyone else, I was just recovering before going back to school. The decision to drop out was made the moment I could stand up for myself again.

  title: Front-end development intern
  employer: Remmaz
  description: Joining a 3 to 5 people size startup at an early stage was the best thing that ever happened to me—not just as a designer and developer, but also as a beginner entrepreneur. Almost nothing was figured out, the product was unclear, the process was unknown, I had a mess of responsibility, and I didn't even have the experience to know where to start. No one was there to guide me when facing everyday challenges—I had to figure out things on my own. The day I left, I walked out knowing tens of ways on how not to do things. And why I left was to find at least one way that's considered right—without risking a startup to fail. Remmaz was a platform that helps students learn to code by doing and having fun as they take interactive challenges all within the browser. And my work helped raise a seeding fund of $15K by winning first place in Jusoor NGO - Lebanon in March 2016.
